# React: Personal Site

This project is an updated version of [Personal Site](https://github.com/ChristianVillalba/personal-site)
using React.        
I created my personal site so I can include my portfolio and my finished projects.     

## Description

The design and functionality pretend to be as clear and intuitive as possible.     
This project combines two different templates from startbootstrap.com: "Agency" & "Resume":         
I liked the structure available in "Resume" but a portfolio section was needed in order to include the projects.         
The Portfolio section in "Agency" was a good fit.     
I personalized the content and the styles working directly with the Bootstrap Repository instead of using the CDN in order to custom the elements and get used to the elements available in this framework.      

This webpage has been updated using React.

This project includes links to my GitHub Page and my LinkedIn Profile.     

All the projects in the PORTFOLIO Section refer to technical skills listed on the "SKILLS" Section on the Site:   
 
The projects in my PORTFOLIO are:  
* Django: Social Media Site  
* Drum Kit  
* Simon Game  
* "This site": instead of open a project, it will describe this site and takes to the Repository on GitHub.  

All the projects except this site were created following some tutorial , however,  
I personalized every single project to add some functionality, change the style or make the design responsive to different viewports.  
Each project includes a brief description and a link to its own repository on GitHub.

The section "CERTIFICATIONS" includes links to the certifications I obtained by finishing the listed courses.
